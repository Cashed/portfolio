# Create a Professional Website

Your assignment is to create a professional website for yourself. The objective is to combine all the learnings from your first week into one project. Specifically, you're be expected to integrate the following concepts.

1. Designing your project with wireframes first
1. Forking this repository to your GitHub account
1. Cloning your fork to your development environment
1. Managing your project from the command line
1. Developing your project in your text editor
1. Testing your project in a browser
1. Integrating [Bootstrap][Bootstrap] into your project
1. Committing your changes to the local Git repository
1. Pushing your commits back to GitHub
1. Deploying your project to a production environment like [Surge][Surge]

Talking about oneself is hard and takes practice. This project is a great opportunity to flex those muscles. Consider this project to be a sandbox. In other words, you can use whatever layout, visuals, and content that you want. Though, it's probably wise to narrow your focus. Here are some tips to help with that.

- If you're feeling more serious, describe your past work history, projects, and outcomes.
- If you're feeling more light-hearted, describe where you see yourself in 1, 5, or 10 years from now.
- Write down any moment in your story that you may want to share.
- Refine those moments by thinking about your audience.
  - Who are you writing this story for?
  - Will the reader know all the important moments by the end?
  - Will the reader's attention start to drift by the end?
- Once you've refined your story, layout your content in a wireframe.
- Limit your project to a maximum of three pages. In fact, one long page is fine.
- Write clean, well-indented, and readable code. It may take you a little longer, but it'll be easier modify in the future.
