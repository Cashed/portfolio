1. Designing your project with wireframes first
1. Forking this repository to your GitHub account
1. Cloning you fork to your development environment
1. Managing your project from the command line
1. Developing your project in your text editor

1. Integrating [Bootstrap][Bootstrap] into your project
1. Committing your project to a Git repository
1. Publishing your project with GitHub

Talking about oneself is hard and takes practice. This project will start to get the juices flowing about how you want to describe yourself.

- If you're feeling more serious, describe your past work history, projects, and outcomes.
- If you're feeling more light-hearted, describe where you see yourself in 1, 5, or 10 years from now.
